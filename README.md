# OSSP_Assignment2

Final Grade: 15/15 - 1 of 14 people to gain full marks

## Disclaimer
It seems the marking was extremely poorly handled and many more should have also achieved full marks, and quite rightly are angry and confused at the module team.

Any updates to the number will be made here. Hopefully people will gain the marks that they deserve.

If you are one of those people who feels they deserve more marks and are looking here for someone else's implementation PLEASE fill out a complaint form in order to get the marks that you deserve.
